        <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Those in Poverty and Lack of Healthcare</h2>
        <p>Poverty is known to contribute to disease and death. 
          In evaluationg data from from the U.S. Census Bureau 
          and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 
          we observe a correlation between those in povery as well as those who lack healthcare.
          Texas appears to be the worst state, suffering from both high povery and lack of healthcare.
          Georgia is second, and Louisiana is third. Interestingly, southern states appear to be
          disproportionately affected. </p>
